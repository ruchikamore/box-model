            <h3>Tropical Deciduous Forest 🌳</h3>
            <p id="para1">Sanjay Gandhi National Park, stretching from Borivali to Thane, is Mumbai’s emerald escape—a tropical deciduous forest right in the city's heart. Home to teak, bamboo, mango, and karanj trees, this jungle thrives with wildlife like leopards, spotted deer, wild boars, langurs, and porcupines. It’s not just a forest—it's Mumbai’s lungs, where nature, history, and adventure meet. From peaceful trails to ancient Kanheri Caves carved into stone, every step feels like a walk through time and wilderness.</p>

            <p id="para3">
                🦩✨ Mumbai’s Silent Guardians
Hidden in the edges of the city — from Versova to Navi Mumbai — lie the mangrove forests 🌊.
These lush, marshy greenlands aren’t just pretty; they’re Mumbai’s natural shield, protecting us from floods and erosion.

Home to crabs 🦀, mudskippers 🐟, and graceful flamingos 🦩, they buzz with life and calm energy.
It’s nature’s way of reminding us that even in chaos, there’s quiet strength. 🌱💚

            <h3>🌴Urban Forest Patches</h3>
            <p id="para3">
            The hidden forests of Aarey, Powai, Film City, and South Mumbai’s hills are where the city’s wild heart quietly beats. These green pockets boast a mix of dense vegetation, towering old banyan trees, native shrubs, and winding forest trails. Often overlooked, they form a mini jungle tucked between Mumbai’s buzzing urban sprawl—a reminder that nature still holds space in the city’s rhythm. It’s where surprise sightings of wildlife meet the rustle of leaves, offering a rare moment of calm and connection in the middle of the chaos.

            <h3>🌿Salt Pan Ecosystems</h3>
            <p id="para4">
                🌿🕊️The green open spaces of Mulund, Wadala, Ghatkopar, and Mankhurd may not be traditional jungles, but they play a vital role in Mumbai’s ecological balance. These areas are rich in saline soil and marsh vegetation, forming unique habitats that support diverse plant life and attract a variety of bird species. Ideal for birdwatching and quiet reflection, they serve as natural buffers and breathing spaces amidst the urban density, quietly contributing to the city’s environmental health and biodiversity.

These quiet, open stretches of water and marshland are a dream come true for bird watchers and nature photographers, offering rare glimpses of avian beauty against serene backdrops. It’s where the wild meets the lens, and every visit feels like a peaceful escape into Mumbai’s hidden wilderness.
